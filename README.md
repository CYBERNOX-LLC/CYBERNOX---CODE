# üß† CYBERNOX-CODE

**An Advanced AI-Powered Code Generation and Rehabilitation Platform**

CYBERNOX-CODE is a standalone, browser-based tool that leverages a multi-stage AI pipeline to generate new code from requirements and rehabilitate existing broken code. It's designed with a strong emphasis on security, quality, and a seamless user experience, featuring a live preview, a mini IDE, and full session management.

## ## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Dual AI Modes**:
    * ‚ö° **Code Generator**: Describe your project in plain English, and the AI will write the complete, functional code for you.
    * üöë **Code Rehabilitation**: Paste in your broken or buggy code, describe the problem, and the AI will analyze, fix, and enhance it.
* **Multi-Stage AI Pipeline**: Each request goes through a transparent, five-stage process (Generation, Security Audit, Optimization, Validation, and Fulfillment) to ensure the highest quality and security standards.
* **Integrated Live Preview**: Instantly see and interact with your generated front-end code in a securely sandboxed `iframe` right on the page.
* **Built-in Mini IDE**: Launch a full-screen code editor to modify the generated code in real-time with a side-by-side preview, offering a complete development loop within the browser.
* **AI Assistant Chat**: Plan your project and flesh out requirements through a conversational AI chat that maintains context and can populate the generator fields for you.
* **Full Session Management**: Never lose your work. Save and load entire sessions‚Äîincluding your inputs, results, and chat history‚Äîusing your browser's local storage.
* **Security-First Design**: Built by CYBERNOX LLC with security in mind, from the AI pipeline's validation stage to the robust sandboxing of the live preview.

## ## How It Works

CYBERNOX-CODE operates entirely within a single `index.html` file. It uses vanilla JavaScript to manage the user interface, state, and logic.

The core AI functionality is powered by API calls to a public AI service (`text.pollinations.ai`). The application intelligently crafts a series of chained prompts for its multi-stage pipeline to progressively build, secure, and refine the code based on the user's initial request. All session and chat data is securely stored locally in your browser using `localStorage` and `IndexedDB`, ensuring your work is private and persistent.
